/*
- Populate an array named `primes` containing the first prime numbers smaller than 100. Consider 2 as the first prime (i.e. `primes[0] == 2`).
  
  - you are free to choose the design and the implementation.

  - please comment and motivate your choices (e.g., allocate one big
    array, or every time I find a new prime number I increase the size of
    the previous `primes` array, etc.)

*Hints*:

- The remainder of a division between two integers is computed as follows:
```c++
unsigned int remainder = 6%3;
```
- Inside a for loop, you can use `continue` to immediately go to the next iteration, `break` to exit the loop. Note that if you have two or more nested loops, the statements affect only the innermost loop.
