/*
- Write a program that reads from stdin the length of an array and then stores in it the numbers given from stdin. 
  The program should then print the numbers in **reverse order**. Remember to free the used memory properly. Divide the problem into two parts:

  1. Write one **template** function that allocates on the *heap* one array of a given size, initializes its elements, and returns the pointer to the first element.

  2. Write a **template** function that prints the elements of an array in the reverse order.

- Test with integers and doubles.

- Use `std::size_t`.

*Hints*: 

- If you have to pass an array to a function, pass the pointer to its first element and the size of the array itself.

- Remember to check your code with `valgrind`. If you have a MAC, you might have nasty surprises. Run `valgrind` on a **Linux**  system. Alternatively, compile and link your code with the following flags `-g -fsanitize=address`  and then run your executable. If it runs fine, you have no memory leaks. If it doesn't, you have some.
