/*
- Implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. Write a code that prints on screen the first prime numbers up to `N` **included**, where `N` is read from stdin. The first printed number is `2`.

```shell
$ ./a.out 
insert number: 5
2
3
5

$ ./a.out
insert number: 10
2
3
5
7
```

*Hints*:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes :)

- the function `std::sqrt`, which computes the square root of a number, is defined in `<cmath>`
```c++
#include <cmath>
...
std::cout << std::sqrt(4) << std::endl;
```
